# Encoded in UTF8
# Vocabularies containing POS, Synonym relationships, wiki abstract, AND a formal english dictionary definition
# Airi should be able to learn new vocabular from formal english dictionary definition
# This file is an effort of program-generated dump from WordNet(or other python/C# NLP libraries) and manual editing (for cleaning up and adding new items)
# Each word shall be defined once; Each sense of the same word is effectively a new word
# The goal of this vocabular sheet is both as a wiki abstract, a data sheet, and a functional dictionary
# Format: 
#	- Line ending with \r or \n or \r\n
#	- Use # at the beginning of line to in dicate comments for the rest of line; No space shall be allowed before # symbol
#	- New words/phrases at the beginning of line after [Word], immediately (no space) followed by a colon and a space then single-space delimited attribute types (POS)
#	- Each sense of the word is defined by a FORMAL ENGLISH DICTIONARY DEFINITION, immediately after [Definition] and <attribute>, it should be a single line of statements consisting of one or more sentences
#   - Different forms of the same word (which indicate small tone change or serve other semantic functions) are all listed after [Form] after [Definition], dependent of definition or POS
#	- Synonyms follow after [Synonym], immediately (no space) followed by a comma delimited list of other words(leading space allowed for readability); Each synnonym corresponds to and differ by each definition
#	- Abstract of the word (used for technical terms) follow [Abstract], no extra new lines are allowed; This is a longer version of definition
#	- Order of above elements are not strict but recommeded ordering as described here; Each word shall be seperated by a blank line; Each definition of word shall be seperated by a commented ------- for readaibility; Leading spaces of lines are always ignored
#	- Unrecognized [Element] will be ignored with a warning, but not causing any side effect; Use this for documentation purpose is needed
#	- Words listed from A-Z in ascending order
