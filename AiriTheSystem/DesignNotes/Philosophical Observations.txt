>>> On Conceptualization
1. People give things/phenomenas a name, they learn to identify, they become familar with its properties, and then they believe they actually understand it.
But when you ask: what exactly caused it, how  does it work? You might not be able to explain.
Inspired by: Electrostatistics, Force
2. (On conception and behavior) To understand what things are (e.g. definitions and properties), and knowing "what they are talking about" reflects understanding and gives us personal interpretations
	——　Deeply knowing the meaning of symbols is enough (and is the fundation) for actions.
3. Self-awarenesss or effect-awareness is simply taking self/effect into consideration before making decisions - ultimately it is measured as the complexity of reflex.
